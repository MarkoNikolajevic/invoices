## Overview
Hello everyone!
Thank you for checking out my solution for this [FrontEnd Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl).ðŸ˜€
Feel free to look around and give me any feedback/suggestion you have.

## My process
My first step was to look at the design and decide what tools I need/want to use to complete this challenge and how I should structure my code. Then I used mobile first approach to build out the app.
### Built with
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) (used to handle forms)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/) (used to animate components)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (used to store data)
- [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) (used to format dates)

I also used **useContext** to pass data between components.

### What I learned
This was the first time I used Supabase, and I learned a lot about how to use it and manage data. I also learned how much important it is to structure and organize your code when building out an app like this.

### What I could do better
- I could have used a more efficient way to write typescript code
- Broke the app into smaller components
- Make more reusable components 
- Add authentication (coming soon...I hopeðŸ˜€)
